# How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Exercise Solutions

My solutions to the exercises presented in Allen Downey's textbook - **How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Java version 4.0**.

## Synopsis

_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ is an excellent introductory computer science textbook by [**Allen Downey**](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/). Although intitially written for Java, it has since been converted to multiple languages, including C, C++, and Python. The later Java versions have been renamed to _Think Java_. This project contains solutions for the version 4.0 of the book, a copy of which can be found in this repository.

The code in this project was written over a span of 3 years, from 2011 to 2014, as part of school assignments. It is presented here unchanged, in its initial form. Development was done via gedit (chapters 1 - 9) and BlueJ (chapters 10 - 18). The exercise solutions for each chapter are in a file named either `ExerciseAnswers` or `README.txt`, with other files providing the Java code.

## Set Up

The programs can all be executed via BlueJ or the Terminal. Follow the instructions in the relevant `ExerciseAnswers` / `README.txt` for detailed instructions.

## Documentation

Since this project consists of exercise solutions, the problem sets themselves act as documentaion. The problems solved are all from the end of chapter exercises in the textbook.

## Contact
